# refactor-homework
This was given to us as a project to practice and use our knowledge of how html and css is supposed to be structured to make changes to the original code and refactor it
without it losing it's original operability. This was a great way for me to learn an on the job skill that is used by many Junior Devs. In a sense I felt like 
this was more of a code review than anything and I was just cleaning things up to make things neater for the people in the future to read. 

The reason that I find this important is because although there may not be anybody working on this project with me currently, if there was to be somebody working on 
some sort of project with me in the future it's important for them to be able to understand what is happening within the code. I feel that you're ability
to say what is happening within the code is just as important as the code itself when working in a team environment and I felt this is what I really learned 
when going through and refactoring this.
